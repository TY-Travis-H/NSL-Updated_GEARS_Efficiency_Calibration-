This program executes the procedure given in the paper 'A method for establishing absolute full-energy peak efficiency and its confidence interval for HPGe detectors' published in Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2015.08.071).

Used the *.dat files as samples to create your own data files.

To execute the file, run the following command

{ echo "1"; echo "Co60_abs_eff_nolog.dat"; echo "3"; echo "Eu152_rel_eff_nolog.dat"; echo "Ba133_rel_eff_nolog.dat";  echo "Co56_rel_eff_nolog.dat"; echo "180"; } | python fixed-main.py

The changes to the main.py from Usman's thesis is the addition of scalar variables assigned with i-th element within an array of data points. This was done for all "for" loops that contained the data arrays. For example, the original had equations that has the array as the variable: matrixX[i][0] = (dataY[i]/dataeY[i])*(log(dataX[i]) - log(x0))**2. However, by adding scalar variables such as xi=float(dataX[i]), yi=float(dataY[i]), eyi=float(dataeY[i]), and wi=yi/eyi, the equation becomes: matrixX[i][0]=wi*(log(xi)-log(x0))**2
